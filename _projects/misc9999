The [**Police Blotter**](/Misc9999) Code for Pittsburgh's project in researching the Police Department use of the Misc 9999 for various reports. Lead tirelessly by [Mark Howe](https://twitter.com/mhowe0422), the project entailed the creation of scripts that scraped public police crime data from City of Pittsburgh `csv` files, parsed and loaded the text to a PostgresSQL database, geocoded it, and displayed the results on fully searchable map.
